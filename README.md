# countskipdate

DeaDBeeF's plugin for count tracks's reproduction, skip determined sections (or complete tracks by rating tag) and write initial/last play dates. You can select minimun rate on Edit/Preferences/Plugins/Countskipdate.

The partial skipping need a tag field named SKIP. For instance if the value is SKIP=0:00:00-0:02:22 (if starts at 0, SKIP=-0:02:22 also works) to skip the first 142 seconds.
